Discord profile pictures are circular. But are they? VSauce music plays The Librarian is all knowing, maybe try confronting him? (refer "The Library" challenge, OSINT)

Solution:

After going to discord and finding the bot named "the librarian", we check it its profile photo since the question says something regarding round images.
We go to discord website, inspect the its profile photo with inspector tools...
It gives this link:

We change the "size=128"  to "size=1024", and we get the image as clear as day!
