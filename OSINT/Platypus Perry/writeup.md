1.	We are given with an audio file, we you listen clearly it doesn’t look like something encoded, its just a normal audio with changed pitch, just reverse it and you will hear English alphabets, write down them, and read them reverse, you’ll get a message “our bug guy David Bombal might tell u something which suits ur brain”.

2.	Now looking at the file name “hire-me” gives you hint of LinkedIn, if you search David Bomabal on LinkedIn search for a “bug bounty” post you’ll see a comment written in “brainfuck”.

4.	Now download that file it’s password protected, now crack the password using “johntheRipper” password is: idgaf

5.	Now you’ll see an image of a guy, just unhide the message in it using online steganography decoder. It has a message “this guy’s pet love them fries, that’s your final pin”.

6.	Now here we have two hints that his pet with fries and “final pin” hints about Pinterest.

7.	First, we need to find this man, by doing reverse image search on Pinterest.

8.	Here we found that he’s a guy “Polishviking” on Instagram, if we search his account and scroll deep in search of a dog pic, you’ll see his post, tagged with the account of his dog!
