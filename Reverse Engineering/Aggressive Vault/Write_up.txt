First dry run: No output

After analizing the binary found:
  [ExE argument]:
    -> Exe accpets an argument
    -> The string is opened as a file
    -> The file needs to exist
    -> The argument is used to work upon the arra of bytes
  
  [Array of bytes]:
    -> Are being processed upon and finally written to a file. 
    -> Output is in an image file
   
  [An ascii string just there]
    -> Points to VishwaCTF website
    -> The site only has one image
  
  Steps to solve:
  
    -> Dowload img on site, keep exe and img in same directory
    -> Open run exe with img name
    [ Output ]
      program leaks memory, before exiting abnormally
      the img file is changed (possibly corrupted or empty)
      
    -> After more analyzing, you find the memory leak, block that function call, remake the exe
    -> Open with the img name with img in same directory, img is changed to the flag
    
    
    [Incase img not found]
    -> Experienced solvers may realize its an encrypted img right away, after reversing the encryption steps, 
       Keys can be tried out to get the expected headder bytes, correct format can be identified from them by looking 
       at the meaningful key string
       creating a file with that name, blocking the mem leak call, the file will be built with your flag in it!

  -> It's just exoring bits of a bmp image with the key string
