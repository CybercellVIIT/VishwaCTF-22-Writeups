**Description:** You and your friend Pinky have a plan to take over the world. But first you need to disable a certain secret weapon. It is hidden inside a twisted maze of passages (a graph) with one entrance. Line containing N, M, and K. The M lines each contain a pair of vertices connected by an edge. Vertices are numbered from 0 (the entrance) to N - 1 (the secret weapon room). The first vertex will always be smaller than the second vertex, and no pair of vertices will appear more than once in the same test case. Edges are bi-directional. With an Added Twist! Match the output and that is the Flag! (Perhaps Some OSINT skills Required)
